								<b>Education:</b>
								I am a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto doing the specialist program in Physics and Astronomy.
								I am highly enthusiastic on computational physics and observational astronomy, hence my executive role
								in the University of Toronto Amateur Astronomers Society and my current research on optical transients 
								with Dr. Dae-Sik Moon
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Research Interests:</b>
								My research has been motivated by the observations conducted by Korean Microlensing Telescope Network;
								with a 24hr continuous southern-sky survey we are able to trigger observations instants after first
								light. My current research is based on a young core-collapse supernova located almost at 450Mpc from Earth
